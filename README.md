## Lead Scoring Model
* Developed a lead scoring model using supervised machine learning algorithms to predict the probability that a loan ("lead") is funded with 95% accuracy
* After performing cross validation and comparing with several models, the LightGBM classifier performed optimally
* Led to a profit of ~ $333,000 (in our scenario, assuming a converted lead yields $120 and the time/effort costs around $15)
* Tools used: Python (Pandas and PyCaret)
